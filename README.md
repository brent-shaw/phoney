## The mouse and keyboard you always have one you

You can use your phone as a mouse and keyboard, no applications needed. 

Run phoney on your PC or laptop and connect to you PC from your phone. Phoney uses websockets to connect your phone to your computer, providing smooth HID movement.

NOTE: This is a proof of concept right now. There are and should be obvious security concerns. The Flask server currently has no authentication, and as such any connection to this server basically has direct and full access to your computer's mouse and keyboard.
